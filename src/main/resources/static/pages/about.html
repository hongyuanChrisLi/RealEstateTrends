			<p>The Real Estate Trends project provides a better understanding
				of the real estate market in Silicon Valley and its vicinities. This
				project comprises of 4 major components: data collection, data
				transformation, backend engineering and frontend presentation.
				Various technologies are utilized to contribute to each piece of
				information and functionality that you see today.</p>

						<h2 class="subHead">Data Collection</h2>
						<p>We use multiple Python tools( Scrapy, Splash, and Selenium)
							to crawl a couple of real estate listing websites for data
							gathering. Our python scripts are optimized to scrape these
							websites in an efficient but leisure fashion, thus to avoid
							overloading their servers and bot detection. In this stage, data
							is preliminarily cleansed and handed to database staging tables.

						<h2 class="subHead">Data Transformation</h2>
						<p>Our MySQL data model loosely complies with star schema
							design, which includes staging, fact, dimension, history and
							report tables. Data transformation is primarily achieved through
							stored procedures and orchestrated by Python scripts. After the
							daily data collection process, staging data is used to update
							fact, dimension, and history tables, on which report data is
							generated. Eventually the local report data is transformed and
							transported to Postgresql databases offered by Heroku cloud
							service.</p>

						<h2 class="subHead">Backend Engineering</h2>
						<p>Powered by Spring Boot, Real Estate Trends backend system
							bridges the database and frontend. The backend system is written
							in Java, accessing PostgreSQL with JPA, creating response in
							RESTful API JSON format, and documenting the RESTful API through
							Swagger. We use Gradle to build this Spring application and
							deploy it as a Tomcat web application resource (WAR) file.</p>

						<p>The frontend development borrowed style settings from a
							template provided by script-tutorial.com. Our interactive charts
							are created with Chart.js, while the rest of our dynamic web
							content is built with AngularJS.</p>
